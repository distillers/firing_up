  "description": "The depths to which JavaScript sucks is well-documented and well-understood. Its main faults are: its lack of module system, weak-typing, verbose function syntax, late bindingÂ², which has led to the creation of various static analysis tools to alleviate this language flaw, but with limited success (there is even a static type checker), finicky equality/automatic conversion, this behaviour, and lack of static types."

There are various ways to do it, but we ought to opt for compiling an existing language, Haskell, to JavaScript, because we do not have time to learn or teach other people a new language, garner a new library set and a new type checker and all that Haskell implementations provide.:"
